MobilityStream is a data stream management system for moving object geospatial trajectories, such as GPS traces. It adds streaming capabilities to the [MobilityDB](https://github.com/MobilityDB/MobilityDB/) geospatial trajectory data management & analysis platform.

MobilityDB is developed by the Computer & Decision Engineering Department of the [Université libre de Bruxelles](https://www.ulb.be/) (ULB) under the direction of [Prof. Esteban Zimányi](http://cs.ulb.ac.be/members/esteban/). ULB is an OGC Associate Member and member of the OGC Moving Feature Standard Working Group ([MF-SWG](https://www.ogc.org/projects/groups/movfeatswg)).
